`rnode` is an experimental version of the optimism protocol built specifically to be
a fault proof program. It must go through the pre-image oracle & be fully determinisitic
with no multi-threaded or networked parts inside the core of derivation.

### TODO

- Fake RPC provider for tests
- Use own block types
- Remove ethers core RLP & use reth-rlp
- Finish MPT
- Finish derivation
- Client / L1 Preimage Oracle API
    - Will be several layers here
- CLI command + usage
